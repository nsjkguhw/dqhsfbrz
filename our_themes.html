		<p>Purpose of the labor market Land as an indispensable factor of production has a number of essential features: 1) limited land plots; 2) the dependence of the efficiency of their use on the location, natural properties, terrain; 3) peculiarities and in the legal regime of land use, including their purpose, encumbrances and restrictions in their use.  The workshop is completely transformed by the joyful excitement of a new impulse of a new idea and a new direction, which are difficult to define, but almost tangible for all participants.  legal establishment of their volume and boundaries.  I admit that this description is too simplistic and the latest research, no doubt, will shed more light on the activity of our brain.  That's when we try to treat the symptoms using the tools of the Personality Ethics arsenal - like a social patch or aspirin.  And the idea of ​​productivity - the very purpose of time management - tends to create tension in relationships rather than develop them.  But my time to help you is limited.  I went through the agony of giving up old habitsbecause I stopped dealing with many of those urgent, pressing problems that are always in front of my eyes and the resolution of which instantly gives a feeling of positive feedback.  Everything that happens to us in life, we explain on the basis of these mental maps.
